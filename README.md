# DepressionDestroyerClient
Client for Depression Destroyer

Welcome to Depression Destroyer, an application designed to help those who feel like they are too arrogant or sad (Or those looking for a few laughs).
This project is broken up into the client, located here, and the server, which provides a wide range of fun and colorful insults & compliments.

Upon opening the client, you will see a smiling Donald Duck, introducing you to the Depression Destroyer. 
There are 4 main settings you can choose from: Yo Mama, Old Timey, Rare, and Cringe! There's also generic compliments & insults.

After clicking one of the settings (or none at all), you can request a compliment or insult, which is provided by our server.

This is just a fun project, and I hope you won't take offense to the insults that may appear.
